# The game for One Card

## Program description

### 1.The main function is in main.c

### 2.When drawing the first card, if two players get card of same rank and suit, player with smaller serial number
will player first.

### 3.One player can have no more than 20 cards (In demo mode, I have never seen a player with more than 18 cards). 
However, you can costomize it by changing the constant "MAX_CARD".

### Draw the cards using ASCII art.


## Bug section

### 1.When you play a card in player mode, if you input characters, the program will lead to a infinite loop.
